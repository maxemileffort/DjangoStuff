1. Make sure we are in virtual env
cd <into project directory>
mkvirtualenv <envname>
	use 'workon <envname>'' to switch between envs

2. initiate django app
python manage.py startapp <appname>
in settings.py in <projectname> directory:
	add <appname> to installed apps list

### Note about where to put app in file structure###
Your apps can live anywhere on your Python path. In this tutorial, we’ll create our poll app right next to your manage.py file 
so that it can be imported as its own top-level module, rather than a submodule of mysite.

To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type "startapp" command.

3. routing app
in <appname> directory:
	create urls.py file
	add following code:
		from django.urls import path

		from . import views

		urlpatterns = [
    		path('', views.<appname>, name='<appname>'),
		]
in <projectname> directory:
	import include, path
	add to urlpatterns list:
		path('<desired route>', include('<appname>.urls')), <--punctuation significant

4. templating app
	in top(project) directory:
		create templates folder
		add html files for templating
		go to settings.py in <projectname> directory
			scoll down to TEMPLATES and add 'templates' to DIRS list
